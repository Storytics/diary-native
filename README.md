### Starting the development server

```shell

When you run \`expo start\` (or \`npm start\`), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the
JavaScript code of our app using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev
Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.
